ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David currently living near Vienna, Austria. I started coding small websites with HTML&CSS in like 3rd grade in middle school (you don't want to see them).
Later I discovered python which I really liked but didn't know what to use it for, so I started learning JS to make my websites more interactive.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Vue.JS

ðŸ‘€ Check out my repository called ```faceit-discord-bot``` it's my biggest project and I'm really proud of it!

ðŸ“« You can reach me on david.drobnak26@gmail.com
